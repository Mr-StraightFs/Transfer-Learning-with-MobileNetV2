# Transfer-Learning-with-MobileNetV2

This Model uses a transfer learning on a pre-trained CNN dubbed MobileNetV2 to build an Alpaca/Not Alpaca classifier! 
MobileNetV2, was designed to provide fast and computationally efficient performance. It's been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images and 1000 classes.

Outlines  :
Create a dataset from a directory
Preprocess and augment data using the Sequential API
Adapt a pretrained model to new data and train a classifier using the Functional API and MobileNet
Fine-tune a classifier's final layers to improve accuracy
